<h1>FIND YOUR HERO</h1>

For my first React project I wanted to build a little front end app.

Thinking to my daughter, I've decided to create a simple web site but not only for her, also for little and big childs !

If you want to downmload it on your device, you will need to use :

-   React create App
-   Reacter Router V6

If you only want to see the final result, you can see it @
